# Simple Geologic Transformations

https://rowanc1.github.io/simple-geology/

Through a sequence of algorithmically defined transformations representing geological events such as sedimentation, folding, faulting, and magmatic intrusion, users can construct and visualize 3D geological models. This repository documents the methodology behind applying these transformations to a spatial dataset of coordinates, with the goal of simulating the geological evolution of a hypothetical region. Each class within the notebook encapsulates a specific geological process, parameterized by real-world measurements.

Based loosely on ideas in Visible Geology.
